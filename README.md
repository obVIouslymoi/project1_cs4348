Hello!

The code consists of 3 files: Logger.java, Encryption.java, Driver.java. 

Logger:
The logger takes input from both the Driver and the Encryption (only when there is an ERROR or RESULT of a word being encrypted, decrypted, or set as the passkey).

Encryption:
The encryption takes input from the Driver and encrypts, decrypts, or sets a word as a passkey. This output is then sent to the looger to be logged.

Driver:
The Driver takes input from the user and passes it through both above programs to complete successfully.

All 3 programs can be run individually, and they do. Logger and Encryption is STDIN nad STDOUT when run on their own. This works completely. 
These are all done through the use of pipes. To run the program through the terminal, please use "java Driver.java".

When I combined with the Driver, I was able to make it work, but then changed something. This led to my Logger and Encryption files not being able to be found by the Driver. 
As much as I tried, I could not complete this in time. I have added comments, explantations and commits to explain my code, work, and through process. This is also seen in my dev log.
I am submitting what I can now, and will keep trying after the deadline. Sorry and thank you.

UPDATE: The program works in its entirety! To run, please use "java Driver.java" in the terminal. Thank you!
